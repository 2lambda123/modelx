 1. Remove 'dev' from the version in __init__.py.
 2. On the master branch, commit the release in git:
      git commit -a -m "DIST: Release v0.X.Y"
      git push
 3. Tag the release and push tags:
      git tag v0.X.Y
      git push origin --tags
 4. Build source and binary wheels for pypi:
      python setup.py sdist
      python setup.py bdist_wheel
 5. Use twine to register and upload the release on pypi.
      twine upload dist/modelx-0.X.Y*
 6. Increment version number and add 'dev' in __init__.py.
 7. Commit your changes and push to master again:
      git commit -a -m "DIST: Bump version back to dev"
      git push
 8. Build the docs on https://readthedocs.org/projects/modelx/.
