.. warning::

   modelx is in its early alpha-release stage, and its specifications are
   subject to changes without consideration on backward compatibility.
   The source files of your models may need to be modified manually,
   if there are updates that break backward compatibility in newer versions
   of modelx.

   Likewise, model files saved with one version may not load with a newer version.
   When updating modelx to a newer version,
   make sure you rebuild model files saved using older versions of modelx
   from their source code.
