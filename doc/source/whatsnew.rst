.. warning::

   With the release of modelx version 0.1.0 in December 2019,
   the author of modelx will try to maintain
   backward compatibility as much as possible
   in developing future releases of modelx.
   Especially, he will try to make it possible to read
   models written to files by one version's :func:`write_model`,
   by :func:`read_model` of the next version of modelx.
   However, models saved by :meth:`Model.backup <core.model.Model.backup>`
   method may not be opened by new version's :func:`restore_model`.

.. End Development Sate
